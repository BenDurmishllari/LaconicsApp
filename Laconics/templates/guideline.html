        <h3> Approach to expenses</h3>
  <p1>Within the UK we work on the basis of the team using good judgment on what is a reasonable
expense for business purposes and seeking to minimize all expense costs where possible.
As we continue with this approach please remember to key points:
All expenses must be claimed within 30 days of the expense date. This timeframe for
obtaining reimbursement is so we can ensure expenses are claimed on a regular basis.
All new expenses must be approved prior to purchase. When you submit your monthly claim
please attach related approval emails. Expense claims without an approval record won't be
reimbursed.
For full guidance please read the Travel & Expenses Policy & Procedure available on our
intranet.</p1>

  <h2>Submission & Approval</h2>
        <h3>Employees</h3>
  <p1> Please submit this form on or before the cut off date advised. Submit claim
form to the Project Manager, along with soft or hard copies of all receipts and
a record of pre-approval for new expenses. Project Managers are required to
check all expenses listed and confirm approval.</p1>

        <h3> Project & Reporting Managers</h3>
  <p1>Project and Reporting Managers are responsible for checking all expense
claims submitted, approving if acceptable and highlighting all non-approved
expenses within 24 hours of receipt. Failure to do so will result in the
employee’s expenses not being reimbursed.</p1>

        <h2>Column Purpose</h2>
      <h3>Date</h3>
  <p1>Date expense was incurred - should match receipt.</p1>
    <h3>Receipt</h3>
  <p1>Y or N (please submit all receipts scanned via email) In accordance with
HMRC rules, all expense claims should be accompanied by a VAT receipt or
invoice. In the rare event that you do not have a receipt, re-imbursement will
be given consideration on a case-by-case basis.</p1>

        <h3>Description</h3>
  <p1>Please enter a short description of the item in the “Description” column.
Where the expense is being claimed for more than one person i.e. shared
taxi, car share, meal please list all those included. In the instance of a group
purchase, the purchase should be made and expensed by the most senior
person in the group where possible.
Where mileage is being claimed the start location, end location and total
mileage travelled must be included.</p1>

        <h3>Category</h3>
  <p1>Select from dropdown. See important note below re: Staff Entertaining v
Subsistence. Where travel is for a project or a general business purpose it
would fall within the group of 'General Travel' categories. The 'Sales Travel'
category is only for activities undertaken specifically for the purpose of client
sales.</p1>

        <h3>Client Name of Saggezza</h3>
  <p1>Enter client name if expense is incurred on behalf of a client / project (select
from drop down).</p1>

  <h3>Client Project</h3>
        <p1>Enter the name of the client project that the expense should be allocated to.</p1>

   <h3>Billable to Client?</h3>
<p1>Y = to be charged back to the client. N= not to be charge to the client. N/A =
not a client / customer cost - if you don't know or are unsure please leave blank</p1>

   <h3>Payment Method</h3>
<p1>Enter 'Own Payment' if paid by own means. Enter 'Corporate Card' if paid for
on a company credit card</p1>
   <h2>Important Category Notes:</h2>
        <h3>Staff Entertaining</h3>
<p1>If you have an expense you’ve categorized as Staff Entertaining this should
be when you’ve taken member/s of the team out for drinks / fun which has no
business purposes beyond mutual relaxation. Such expenses must have
documented pre-approval from a manager.</p1>

    <h3>Subsistence</h3>
<p1>If any business issues or topics are being discussed (whether it be in a pub,
office, restaurant, team work breakfast), then any refreshments or food would
count as Subsistence.</p1>
    <h3>Other</h3>
<p1>Avoid use where possible and only use by exception if no other category applies</p1>>
        <h3>Mileage</h3>
<p1>Mileage may be claimed at 0.45p per mile up to 10,000 miles. In the
description box please put destination start, destination end, purpose of
journey, miles, mileage rate.</p1>>
